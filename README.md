# Overview of the project

## 𝕿𝖍𝖊 𝕭𝖎𝖌𝖌𝖊𝖗 𝕻𝖗𝖔𝖏𝖊𝖈𝖙

A project with React Native, Express, and Postgres.

### Time and dates

The project will start on Sunday, 4th April.
Demos will happen on the start of Thursday, 8th April.

### Team structure

This time you will choose your own crew!
Each team must be composed of three or four people.

To join a team:

- Talk with each other and decide who your team is, and when you are ready, send the list on the newly created teams channel. Give your team a name.
- If you don't have any pereferences, just send the message "free" on the team channel.

### Objective

Build any application consisting of React Native frontend and Express backend with the following specs:

- Authentication
- Roles and permissions (only specific users can do specific actions)

#### Recommended idea

Build a forum or chat app where users can create different channels and include specific users who get access to those channels.
Only the creator of the channel or the comment inside of the channel can delete or edit the comment.

#### Bonus

Would be super cool if you have:

- Many to many relation between a model and itself
- Real time updates
